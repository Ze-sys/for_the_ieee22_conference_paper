### [![Open app in Streamlit, if deployed](https://static.streamlit.io/badges/streamlit_badge_black_white.svg)](STREAMLIT_SHARE_URL_COMMING)


<a>
This repo contains a streamlit app that was used to build and train autoencoder models for the ieee'22 OCEANS conference paper (Paper ID 2022169954). 
Only Dense layers were used in the models. I ran out of time to finish the models with CNN layers. 
New models can be built and and saved. However, due to resource constraints, the app needS to be run locally. An image will be added to DockerHub soon.
In addition to the hydrophone spectrogram images used in the paper, the models in this repo are trained on WERA radar Range-Cell (RC) images.
</a>
Details to come soon.
